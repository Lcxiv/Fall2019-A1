This program has as a goal to calculate Dna strings from a file and return some statistics such as sum, variance, standard deviation, probability of each letters and bigrams. It also has the possibility to calculate more than one file.

I decided to do all my program from the main to see how difficult and messy it would be compared to the usage of classes and functions. The reason I chose to do that was that it matched the idea of only using primitives to realize how important data structures are.

Here are the sources I used to help myself:
